## What this project is

This project was made as a side project to showcase my current skills with this stack. It is built with the guidance of the following designed Figma pages:

1. Sign Up
   ![screen 1](/docs/images/Desktop%20-%206.png)
1. Login
   ![screen 2](/docs/images/Desktop%20-%202.png)
1. Home

1. Edit

1. New
   ![screen 5](/docs/images/Desktop%20-%205.png)

So this is what I did!

## Discussion

For the technical decisions I made, I used JWT Cookie authentication for simplicity, however, this would vary based on the nature of the project i.e. the scale, the use case and the architecture. Also, for fetching data from the client, login and other multiple interactions between the client and the server could be improved, but I went with the simplest solutions to keep things easy.

The project is missing so much functionality, like skeletons for loading for example. I also didn't go crazy with the design system in Tailwind config because colors were all over the place in the Figma design. I did what I could do best.

The project is also not responsive; the provided design was only for desktop, so, you get it.

Feel free to go through the README.md for each of the directories to understand how to use. Thanks and good luck!
