# Phonebook Client App

This app is made with love â™¥ and also NextJS, Tailwind and TypeScript. I used pnpm for a package manager, so you will have to deal with its ease and greatness -instead of npm. Sorry for improving the quality of your life..

## Usage

In order to be able to use this app, you will have to follow these steps:

1. `pnpm i`
2. `touch .env` or create the `.env` file
3. Add the values from `.env.example` file
4. `pnpm dev`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Hopefully this does it, if not, let me know.

## Error Handling

I did my best with the given time for error handling. I display the common errors with friendly messages, however, I did not go crazy with error messages, some of them are not the frindliest.
