# Phonebook Server App

This server is made with love â™¥ and also NodeJS, Express and TypeScript. I used pnpm for a package manager, so you will have to deal with its ease and greatness -instead of npm. Sorry for improving the quality of your life..

## Usage

In order to be able to use this app, you will have to follow these steps:

1. `pnpm i`
2. `touch .env` or create the `.env` file
3. Add the values from `.env.example` file
4. `pnpm dlx prisma generate`
5. `pnpm dlx prisma db seed`
6. `pnpm dev`

Hopefully this does it, if not, let me know.

## Error Handling

I did my best with the given time for error handling. I handled most of the expected Prisma Errors and other common errors, however, this was not my best job handling errors from the backend.
